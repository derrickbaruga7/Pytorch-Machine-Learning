# Pytorch-Machine-Learning
This PyTorch project predicts sales using historical purchase data. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training with a neural network. The model uses mean squared error loss and mini-batch processing via `DataLoader`. The final test set MSE is approximately 0.9664. Full code and instructions are provided.
